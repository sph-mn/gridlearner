# gridlearner

*status: in development, no functional version yet*

single-file web application for displaying pairs from space-separated dsv file content in grid format.
the grids function as interactive, spatial memory-matching learning games, loosely akin to the game "concentration" or flashcards.

four modes are available:

* synonym: match questions that share the same answer
* pair: match questions with their corresponding answers
* single: click to reveal one answer at a time
* which: match one question to the correct answer among random answers

this application is useful for memorizing new information and reinforcing recall and association skills.

to run the application, serve the html file in the compiled/ directory using a web server, either locally or over the internet, and open it in a browser.
